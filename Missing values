| Missing values play an important role in statistics and data analysis. Often,
| missing values must not be ignored, but rather they should be carefully
| studied to see if there's an underlying pattern or cause for their
| missingness.

...

  |                                                                              |====                                                                  |   5%
| In R, NA is used to represent any value that is 'not available' or 'missing'
| (in the statistical sense). In this lesson, we'll explore missing values
| further.

...

  |                                                                              |=======                                                               |  10%
| Any operation involving NA generally yields NA as the result. To illustrate,
| let's create a vector c(44, NA, 5, NA) and assign it to a variable x.

> x<-c(44.NA,5,NA)
Error: unexpected numeric constant in "x<-c(44.NA"
> x<-c(44,NA,5,NA)

| You are amazing!

  |                                                                              |===========                                                           |  15%
| Now, let's multiply x by 3.

> x*3
[1] 132  NA  15  NA

| You are doing so well!

  |                                                                              |==============                                                        |  20%
| Notice that the elements of the resulting vector that correspond with the NA
| values in x are also NA.

...

  |                                                                              |==================                                                    |  25%
| To make things a little more interesting, lets create a vector containing
| 1000 draws from a standard normal distribution with y <- rnorm(1000).

> y<-rnorm(1000)

| You're the best!

  |                                                                              |=====================                                                 |  30%
| Next, let's create a vector containing 1000 NAs with z <- rep(NA, 1000).

> z<-rep(NA,1000)

| That's a job well done!

  |                                                                              |=========================                                             |  35%
| Finally, let's select 100 elements at random from these 2000 values
| (combining y and z) such that we don't know how many NAs we'll wind up with
| or what positions they'll occupy in our final vector -- my_data <-
| sample(c(y, z), 100).

> my_data<-samplec(c(y,z),100)
Error in samplec(c(y, z), 100) : could not find function "samplec"
> my_data<-sample(c(y,z),100)

| You are amazing!

  |                                                                              |============================                                          |  40%
| Let's first ask the question of where our NAs are located in our data. The
| is.na() function tells us whether each element of a vector is NA. Call
| is.na() on my_data and assign the result to my_na.

> my_na<- is.na(my_data)

| You are doing so well!

  |                                                                              |================================                                      |  45%
| Now, print my_na to see what you came up with.

> my_na
  [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [13]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
 [25]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
 [37]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
 [49]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
 [61]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
 [73]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
 [85] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
 [97]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE

| You are doing so well!

  |                                                                              |===================================                                   |  50%
| Everywhere you see a TRUE, you know the corresponding element of my_data is
| NA. Likewise, everywhere you see a FALSE, you know the corresponding element
| of my_data is one of our random draws from the standard normal distribution.

...

  |                                                                              |======================================                                |  55%
| In our previous discussion of logical operators, we introduced the `==`
| operator as a method of testing for equality between two objects. So, you
| might think the expression my_data == NA yields the same results as is.na().
| Give it a try.

> 
> my_data==NA
  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [26] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [51] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [76] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |                                                                              |==========================================                            |  60%
| The reason you got a vector of all NAs is that NA is not really a value, but
| just a placeholder for a quantity that is not available. Therefore the
| logical expression is incomplete and R has no choice but to return a vector
| of the same length as my_data that contains all NAs.

...

  |                                                                              |==============================================                        |  65%
| Don't worry if that's a little confusing. The key takeaway is to be cautious
| when using logical expressions anytime NAs might creep in, since a single NA
| value can derail the entire thing.

...

  |                                                                              |=================================================                     |  70%
| So, back to the task at hand. Now that we have a vector, my_na, that has a
| TRUE for every NA and FALSE for every numeric value, we can compute the total
| number of NAs in our data.

...

  |                                                                              |====================================================                  |  75%
| The trick is to recognize that underneath the surface, R represents TRUE as
| the number 1 and FALSE as the number 0. Therefore, if we take the sum of a
| bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs, we get the total number of TRUEs.

...

  |                                                                              |========================================================              |  80%
| Let's give that a try here. Call the sum() function on my_na to count the
| total number of TRUEs in my_na, and thus the total number of NAs in my_data.
| Don't assign the result to a new variable.

> sum(my_na)
[1] 46

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |                                                                              |============================================================          |  85%
| Pretty cool, huh? Finally, let's take a look at the data to convince
| ourselves that everything 'adds up'. Print my_data to the console.
